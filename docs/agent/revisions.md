# Revision History

Use the `history` graph to record why graph state changed, what graph roles
changed, what graph roles were included for review, and where a reviewer can
inspect the resulting bundle.

The current helper is `doxabase.record_graph_revision`. It records metadata; it
does not compute diffs or apply graph edits. Use it after helper-authored map
changes, imports, exports, or field-trial review bundles when the rationale
should remain available to later agents.

## When To Record

Record a graph revision when you can say:

- these graph roles changed or were consolidated;
- these graph roles were included in the review/export context;
- this is why the change was made;
- these observations, claims, patterns, or evidence supported it;
- this validation result or export path helps a future reviewer.

Do not use ordinary revision records for `base_ontology` or `base_shapes`.
Changes to shipped seed graphs are package migrations, not project edits.

## Example

```python
validation = db.validate_graph(scope="all")
export = db.export_trig("/tmp/project-review.trig")

db.record_graph_revision(
    summary="Project review bundle exported",
    rationale="The map helper field trial produced current-best map facts and supporting observations.",
    changed_graphs=["map", "observations", "patterns", "evidence"],
    included_graphs=export.graphs,
    revision_type="rc:ExportRevision",
    supporting_patterns=[
        "https://example.test/project#pattern_doc_id_parent_doc_id_spine",
    ],
    export_path=export.path,
    graph_counts=export.graph_counts,
    validation_scope=validation.scope,
    validation_conforms=validation.conforms,
    validation_result_count=validation.result_count,
)
```

If an agent records new observations or patterns but leaves the map unchanged,
keep `changed_graphs` narrow and include the map only as review context:

```python
export = db.export_trig("/tmp/project-review.trig", graphs="workflow")

db.record_graph_revision(
    summary="No-map-edit review bundle exported",
    rationale="The map was exported for reviewer context, but only observations, patterns, and evidence changed.",
    changed_graphs=["observations", "patterns", "evidence"],
    included_graphs=export.graphs,
    revision_type="rc:FieldTrialRevision",
    export_path=export.path,
    graph_counts=export.graph_counts,
)
```

When `graph_counts` is supplied, DoxyBase also records those graph roles as
included review/snapshot context. Passing `included_graphs=export.graphs` makes
that distinction explicit for readers.

## Revision Types

Common revision type IRIs:

- `rc:ManualRevision`
- `rc:ImportRevision`
- `rc:ExportRevision`
- `rc:MapAuthoringRevision`
- `rc:FieldTrialRevision`

Use project-specific revision types if these are too coarse. Declare custom
revision types as `rc:RevisionType` resources in project ontology before relying
on `validate_graph(scope="all")`.

## Limits

DoxaBase does not yet have staged graph revision sessions, graph diffs, or
conflict handling. The revision helper is scaffolding for that future workflow:
it preserves rationale and review context now, while leaving full slice
replacement for later.
